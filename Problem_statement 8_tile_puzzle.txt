### Assignment 1 
* Implement the 8-tile puzzle using `Bi-directional search`
* For less credits, use `IDS`
* Can use any language for coding it up.

#### Self Notes
* Use threads to implement the search in each direction to achieve O(b^[d/2]) time complexity
* Also, store info about nodes encountered from only 1 side of the search
* Maybe use locks for the shared data structure that has the 'closed' nodes
* Before proceeding, make the parity test to see if goal state is attainable


#### Stuff remaining
* Add input validation(0-8)
* Improve output format
* Improve comments
* Add no.of states generated in final output
